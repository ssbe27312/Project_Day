# Project_Day
Brain-Computer Interfaces Project, we developed the study assistant service, called "Day"

This BCI service could support growing ability of concentration(Beta wave) for anyone who are in difficulty studying

We collected EEG data using MAVE Headband
We developed BCI service based on Unity Engine and C# script, as well as to process EEG data(FFT data), also used Python script
